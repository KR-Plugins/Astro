# Info
**Updated [Astro](https://github.com/aiczk/Astro) plugin from [Aiczk] for .NET7 and Dalamud API 8 
All credits go to him since this is only a compatibility update for patch 6.3.**

All the functionality and the code is the same as the original one for now.

## About
Astro realizes the system by forcibly intervening in the action cue system.

Therefore, the oGCD may be invalidated, but please forgive me.

### Detail
Players with a card effect, a weakness effect, or a damage down effect are skipped.

For example, if Melee has the above debuff, Astro distributes The Balance to Range.
